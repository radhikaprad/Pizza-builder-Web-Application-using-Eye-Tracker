# Pizza builder Web Application using Eye Tracker
# Abstract
>> User experience evaluation with eye tracking system evaluates user experience with various interactive application using an eye tracker device. We evaluate by calculating time spent on a web application using a mouse compared to web application access using an eye tracking device. We present pointing and selection functionalities.
>> The device tracks the eye movement for pointing objects on a user interface and a left eye blink gesture for selection of objects on a web application. We implemented algorithm that smoothens the movement of the cursor by averaging multiple positions for consistent eye movement. We receive zero value reading for closed eyes. Zero valued reading for more than 500 milliseconds is considered a click.
>> Our project implements two different types of Pizza Ordering web application, differentiating each other with its design and alignment of pizza components. A study on the survey taken at the end of each user experience is done, that helps us analyze the effective degree of the device, user preference and the comfort level. Eye tracking device makes gaze based pointing and selection effective and with low cost tracking devices It will be possible for such gaze-based techniques be replaced for mouse, an alternative to input form.
